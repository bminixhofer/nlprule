A fast, low-resource Natural Language Processing and Error Correction library written in Rust. nlprule implements a rule- and lookup-based approach to NLP using resources from [LanguageTool](github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool).

  <summary>Python Usage</summary>

Install: `pip install nlprule`

Use:
```python
from nlprule import Tokenizer, Rules

tokenizer = Tokenizer.load("en")
rules = Rules.load("en", tokenizer)
```
```python
rules.correct("He wants that you send him an email.")
# returns: 'He wants you to send him an email.'

rules.correct("I can due his homework.")
# returns: 'I can do his homework.'

for s in rules.suggest("She was not been here since Monday."):
    print(s.start, s.end, s.replacements, s.source, s.message)
# prints:
# 4 16 ['was not', 'has not been'] WAS_BEEN.1 Did you mean was not or has not been?
```
```python
for sentence in tokenizer.pipe("A brief example is shown."):
    for token in sentence:
        print(
            repr(token.text).ljust(10),
            repr(token.span).ljust(10),
            repr(token.tags).ljust(24),
            repr(token.lemmas).ljust(24),
            repr(token.chunks).ljust(24),
        )
# prints:
# ''         (0, 0)     ['SENT_START']           []                       []                      
# 'A'        (0, 1)     ['DT']                   ['A', 'a']               ['B-NP-singular']       
# 'brief'    (2, 7)     ['JJ']                   ['brief']                ['I-NP-singular']       
# 'example'  (8, 15)    ['NN:UN']                ['example']              ['E-NP-singular']       
# 'is'       (16, 18)   ['VBZ']                  ['be', 'is']             ['B-VP']                
# 'shown'    (19, 24)   ['VBN']                  ['show', 'shown']        ['I-VP']                
# '.'        (24, 25)   ['.', 'PCT', 'SENT_END'] ['.']                    ['O']
```

  <summary>Rust Usage</summary>

Recommended setup:

`Cargo.toml`
```toml
[dependencies]
nlprule = "<version>"

[build-dependencies]
nlprule-build = "<version>" # must be the same as the nlprule version!
```

`build.rs`
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("cargo:rerun-if-changed=build.rs");

    nlprule_build::BinaryBuilder::new(
        &["en"],
        std::env::var("OUT_DIR").expect("OUT_DIR is set when build.rs is running"),
    )
    .build()
    .validate();
}
```

`src/main.rs`
```rust
use nlprule::{Rules, Tokenizer, tokenizer_filename, rules_filename};

fn main() {
    let mut tokenizer_bytes: &'static [u8] = include_bytes!(concat!(
        env!("OUT_DIR"),
        "/",
        tokenizer_filename!("en")
    ));
    let mut rules_bytes: &'static [u8] = include_bytes!(concat!(
        env!("OUT_DIR"),
        "/",
        rules_filename!("en")
    ));

    let tokenizer = Tokenizer::from_reader(&mut tokenizer_bytes).expect("tokenizer binary is valid");
    let rules = Rules::from_reader(&mut rules_bytes).expect("rules binary is valid");

    assert_eq!(
        rules.correct("She was not been here since Monday.", &tokenizer),
        String::from("She was not here since Monday.")
    );
}
```

`nlprule` and `nlprule-build` versions are kept in sync.

## Main features

- Rule-based Grammatical Error Correction through multiple thousand rules.
- A text processing pipeline doing sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, lemmatization, chunking and disambiguation.
- Support for English, German and Spanish.
- Spellchecking. (*in progress*)

## Goals

- A single place to apply spellchecking and grammatical error correction for a downstream task.
- Fast, low-resource NLP suited for running:
    1. as a pre- / postprocessing step for more sophisticated (i. e. ML) approaches.
    2. in the background of another application with low overhead.
    3. client-side in the browser via WebAssembly.
- 100% Rust code and dependencies.

## Comparison to LanguageTool

|         | \|Disambiguation rules\| | \|Grammar rules\| | LT version   | nlprule time | LanguageTool time |
|---------|--------------------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| English | 843 (100%)               | 3725 (~ 85%)      | 5.2          | 1            | 1.7 - 2.0         |
| German  | 486 (100%)               | 2970 (~ 90%)      | 5.2          | 1            | 2.4 - 2.8         |
| Spanish | *Experimental support. Not fully tested yet.*
